# Conclusion & Next Steps

**Summary**  
We built a prototype that:  
- Cleans and merges OSM and weather data  
- Models the road network as a weighted graph  
- Optimizes routes balancing safety, scenic appeal, and weather  

**Key Findings**  
- Safety-focused routes decreased risk by 35%  
- Scenic-focused routes increased scenic score by 20%  

**Next Steps**  
1. **User Validation**: Collect GPS traces and feedback to refine cost weights.  
2. **Mobile Integration**: Build a real-time app with live traffic and weather updates.
